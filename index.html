<h1>AFL PREVIEW 2017</h1>
<p>How will your team fare in the 2017 AFL season? How will your teams newest signings go? Who will rain supreme? All those quetions will be answered this year right hre with the 2017 AFL season. Enjoy!.</p>
    
    <p>18. Brisbane</p>
    
    <p> It was a horrible 2016 for the Lions and I can't see them getting any better in the 2017 season. As I'm writing this it looks like their captain Tom Rockliff is out the door to the magpies, and the club culture is very weak. Appart from appointing a new coach, the Lions board has not made any effort to start a rebuild, and as much as I hate to tell Lions fans, the future is ooking very grim for them in years to come.</p>
    
    <P>Best 22:</P>

    <P>B: Marco Paparone, Harris Andrews, Darcy Gardiner
HB: Daniel Rich, Jack Frost, Sam Mayes
C: Ryan Bastinac, Dayne Beams, Allen Christensen
HF: Lewis Taylor, Josh Walker, Dayne Zorko
F: Josh Schache, Eric Hipwood, Ben Keays
R: Stefan Martin, Mitch Robinson, Tom Rockliff
IC: Tom Cutler, Tom Bell, Rhys Mathieson, Rohan Bewick</p> 
    
    <p> 17. Gold Coast</p>
    
    <P>It was another horrible year for the suns, who just 3 years back were showing enough promise to be mounting a premeirship challange by this time, but somehow things have just fallen away for them. 2013 NAB rising star Jager O'Meara looks set to end up at the Hawks but the Suns are adamant that they are looking for a quallity player in return. AFL in Quensland seems to be a serious problem, and on the club culture front, the suns are worse than the Lions. I can't see this team winning more thn 3 games this year, and a very grim season awaits for all of Queensland AFL.</p>
    <p> Best 22:</p>
<P>B: Adam Saad, Rory Thompson, Kade Kolodjashnij
HB: Nick Malceski, Steven May, Jarrod Harbrow
C: Touk Miller, Matt Rosa, Pearce Hanley
HF: Jack Martin, Tom Lynch, Aaron Hall
F: Sam Day, Peter Wright, Alex Sexton
R: Jarrod Witts, David Swallow, Gary Ablett
IC: Jarryd Lyons, Jesse Lonergan, Brayden Fiorini, Callum </P>
    
    <P>16. Essendon </P>
    
    <p> Considering the circumstances the Bombers were put under, this season was exremely positive. 3 wins more than anyone expected them to get, they only got the wooden spoon by 0.6%, suprising many. However this season will be much different.
    With all the banned players back, many can see dons going as far as September this year, but I can't. They simply don't have the midfield power, the backline power or the fowardline power.</P>
    
       <P> B: Mark Baguley, Cale Hooker, Aaron Francis
HB: Brendon Goddard, Michael Hurley, Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti
C: Zach Merrett, Jobe Watson, Brent Stanton
HF: David Zaharakis, Joe Daniher, Travis Colyer
F: Orazio Fantasia, James Stewart, Jayden Laverde
R: Matthew Leuenberger, Dyson Heppell, Heath Hocking
IC: Tom Bellchambers, David Myers, Darcy Parish, Kyle Langford</p>
    
    <P>15.Fremantle </P>
    
    <P>The Dockers 2016 frefall was not necessarilly suprising to all, but it was for many. A terrible 2016 has mad them immideiatley think about rebuilding, unlike Gold Coast and Brisbane. Bringing in the likes of Cam Mcarthy, Joel Hamling and Brad Hill from GWS the Western Bulldogs and Hawthorn respectivley is a start, but their rebuild is far from done, which is why I'm placing them so low down the table. However for Dockers fans their are lenty of good signs, and I would be far from suprised if they finished a lot, lot higher in 2017, however their list, could use some improving.</p>
   
       <p> B: Michael Johnson, Joel Hamling, Lee Spurr
HB: Garrick Ibbotson, Alex Pearce, Danyle Pearce
C: Stephen Hill, Nathan Fyfe, Bradley Hill
HF: Lachie Weller, Matt Taberner, Michael Walters
F: Hayden Ballantyne, Cam McCarthy, Zac Clarke
R: Aaron Sandilands, David Mundy, Lachie Neale
IC: Harley Bennell, Tom Sheridan, Cameron Sutcliffe, Shane Kersten</P>
    
    <p>14. Richmond</p>

    <P>The Tigers missed the finals for the first time since 2012 last year, and s hungry as they would be to be back in Septembr action I give them no chance. Their midfield that consists of Dusty Martin and Trent Cotchin is simply not hard enough and the rest of the team isnot good enough to play finals, let aln make the top 10.</P>
    
  <P>  B: David Astbury, Alex Rance, Nick Vlaustin
HB: Brandon Ellis, Dylan Grimes, Bachar Houli
C: Josh Caddy, Dustin Martin, Anthony Miles
HF: Shane Edwards, Jack Riewoldt, Sam Lloyd
F: Oleg Markov, Ben Griffiths, Daniel Rioli
R: Toby Nankervis, Dion Prestia, Trent Cotchin
IC: Shaun Hampson, Reece Conca, Shaun Grigg, Chris Yarran</P>
    
    
    <P>13. Carlton</P>
    
<p> Many could argue a higher or lower spot for the blues but I think 13th is about fair. A great start under Brendan Bolton slowly faded away. I think this year will bemuch the same. Much lke the Giants first few years, good performances will slowly take their toll on a young, rebuilt squad. Another talking point will be about Bryce Gibbs not securing his move to Adelaide, and if it will cause any disharony amongst the squad.</p>
    
  <P>  B: Caleb Marchbank, Lachlan Plowman, Sam Rowe
HB: Sam Docherty, Jacob Weitering, Kade Simpson
C: Dennis Armfield, Patrick Cripps, Ed Curnow
HF: Dale Thomas, Levi Casboult, Rhys Palmer
F: Jack Silvagni, Matthew Kreuzer, Matthew Wright
R: Andrew Phillips, Bryce Gibbs, Marc Murphy
      IC: Sam Kerridge, Nick Graham, Dylan Buckley, Simon White</P>

<P>12. North Melbourne</P>

<p>The Kangaroos were making the back page every day in 2016 for all the right, and then wrong reasons. An easy draw for the first 9 weeks of the competition gave them 9 wins, but as soon as thre going got tough, Brad Scotts team fell apart, and this year, a much harder draw will se them fall even further down the ladder. It must also be mentioned that they delisted club legends Michael Firrito, Drew Petrie and AFL record game holder Brent Harvey, as well as arguably their best player in Nick Dal Santo. Somethings not right at the club, and next year I expect it to show on the pitch.    </p>

<P>11. Collingwood</P>

<P>It's the same old story every year for the pies. Huge expectations at the start of the year, people being dissapointed but still hopefull in the first 5 rounds, but by round 15 they have lost all hope and the pies fans are talking about next year. Unfortunatley for pies fans, while they may cause a few upsets along the way, they don't stand a chance when the going gets tough. Their list still needs a fair bit of developing before they get near the top, and you can sense that the boards support of Nathan Buckley is going to be seriously tested. </P>
<p>B: Tyson Goldsack, Lachlan Keeffe, Josh Smith
HB: Jeremy Howe, Ben Reid, Travis Varcoe
C: Steele Sidebottom, Taylor Adams, James Aish
HF: Daniel Wells, Darcy Moore, Jarryd Blair
F: Chris Mayne, Jesse White, Jamie Elliott
R: Brodie Grundy, Scott Pendlebury, Adam Treloar
IC: Will Hoskin-Elliott, Alex Fasolo, Jack Crisp, Jordan De Goey</p>

<P>10. Port opted for stability over drastic change at the trade table — largely because of a belief its best 22 has the ability to rescale the heights of 2014 and a desperate need to inject some young talent at draft time after trading out picks for players in recent seasons.
Patrick Ryder returns as a knight in shining armour after the mess that was the Power’s ruck situation last season and a decent run with injuries will see them threaten for a finals spot.
But depth is still a major concern and the defence has rarely been top four material during the Hinkley era. </P>
<P>B: Tom Jonas, Jack Hombsch, Matt Broadbent
HB: Jasper Pittard, Jackson Trengove, Hamish Hartlett
C: Jared Polec, Travis Boak, Brad Ebert
HF: Jarman Impey, Justin Westhoff, Sam Gray
F: Aaron Young, Charlie Dixon, Chad Wingard
R: Patrick Ryder, Ollie Wines, Robbie Gray
IC: Matt White, Angus Monfries, Karl Amon, Nathan Krakouer</P>

<P>9. Melbourne</P>

<P>Is retaining Jesse Hogan and adding Jordan Lewis and Michael Hibberd enough to push the Demons over the edge? It would be a romantic rise in Simon Goodwin’s first season as coach but it’s still a huge ask.
Like the Tigers, Melbourne’s margin of defeat was triple figures in round 23 so there’s clearly work to do.
The Demons are building reasonable depth and will have a midfield that can match most, but unless Hogan makes a jump to 60 goals a season territory they may fall just short in their battle with St Kilda for eighth place.
</P>
<P>B: Tomas Bugg, Tom McDonald, Neville Jetta
HB: Michael Hibberd, Oscar McDonald, Jayden Hunt
C: Angus Brayshaw, Nathan Jones, Dom Tyson
HF: Jordan Lewis, Jack Watts, Christian Petracca
F: Sam Wiedeman, Jesse Hogan, Jeff Garlett
R: Max Gawn, Bernie Vince, Jack Viney
IC: Clayton Oliver, Billy Stretch, Dean Kent, Christian Salem</P>

<P>8. St Kilda</P>

<P>Any one of a half dozen teams has an argument for scraping into the last position in the eight but based on the fact they only missed out by percentage last season and their improving depth we’ll go with the Saints.
The inclusion of Jake Carlisle, Nathan Brown, Koby Stevens and Jack Steele could mean a handful of players that defeated Brisbane by 58 points in round 23 — like Shane Savage, Jack Lonie, Brandon White, Nathan Wright and Daniel McKenzie — find themselves in the reserves from time to time.
The key focus for Alan Richardson has to be making his team harder to score against. There was a huge difference between the 92.7 points per game St Kilda conceded each week to the worst defence in the top eight (North Melbourne, 84.5 ppg).</P>
<P>B: Dylan Roberton, Nathan Brown, Sean Dempster
HB: Jarryn Geary, Jake Carlisle, Leigh Montagna
C: Koby Stevens, David Armitage, Blake Acres
HF: Mav Weller, Nick Riewoldt, Jack Billings
F: Tim Membrey, Josh Bruce, Patrick McCartin
R: Tom Hickey, Seb Ross, Jack Steven
IC: Jack Steele, Luke Dunstan, Jack Newnes, Jade Gresham</P>

<p>7. Hawthorn</p>

<P>The Hawks argued they made a net gain by bringing in Tom Mitchell, Jaeger O’Meara and Ty Vickery for Sam Mitchell, Jordan Lewis and Brad Hill.
While that may be true in the long-term (if you forget about all the draft picks they no longer have), it’s hard to envision Hawthorn not taking a step back next season.
The new faces will need time to gel and any drop-off from the likes of Josh Gibson, Luke Hodge and Shaun Burgoyne could see this side falling fast.
Jarryd Roughead would obviously make a huge difference but his return is of secondary importance in the grand scheme of things so the likes of James Sicily and Ryan Schoenmakers need to take big strides.</P><P>B: Shaun Burgoyne, James Frawley, Ben Stratton
HB: Luke Hodge, Josh Gibson, Grant Birchall
C: Billy Hartung, Jaeger O’Meara, Isaac Smith
HF: Luke Breust, James Sicily, Cyril Rioli
F: Paul Puopolo, Ty Vickery, Jack Gunston
R: Ben McEvoy, Tom Mitchell, Liam Shiels
IC: Brendan Whitecross, Ryan Schoenmakers, Taylor Duryea, Kaiden Brand

</P>

<P>6. Adelaide</P>
<P>Is one player really the difference between finishing top two or outside the top four? When the ladder is as close as last season (one game separating first from sixth), the answer is yes.
Unfortunately for the Crows that could mean an inability to find a suitable trade for Bryce Gibbs could cost them a long-awaited Grand Final appearance.
Adelaide’s stability is a plus but a league-wide consensus its midfield needed improving is accurate and the issue has only worsened through the departure of Jarryd Lyons.</P>
<P>B: Luke Brown, Kyle Hartigan, Kyle Cheney
HB: Rory Laird, Daniel Talia, Brodie Smith
C: Brad Crouch, Scott Thompson, Charlie Cameron
HF: Tom Lynch, Taylor Walker, Richard Douglas
F: Eddie Betts, Josh Jenkins, Mitch McGovern
R: Sam Jacobs, Rory Sloane, Matt Crouch
IC: Rory Atkins, Jake Lever, David Mackay, Wayne Milera</P>

<P>5. Geelong</P>

<P>The added cohesion the Cats will expect to gain in 2017 following another year with recent inclusions Patrick Dangerfield, Zac Smith, Lachie Henderson and co. could be offset by the departures of Jimmy Bartel, Corey Enright and Josh Caddy.
Enright’s exit will be the most severely felt — Zach Tuohy is a more than handy replacement but he’s not an All-Australian.
Aaron Black and Nakia Cockatoo are the wildcards. If they can find their best form it may be enough to push the Cats into the big one.</P>
<P>B: Lachie Henderson, Tom Lonergan, Zach Tuohy
HB: Andrew Mackie, Harry Taylor, Jake Kolodjashnij
C: Sam Menegola, Joel Selwood, Mark Blicavs
HF: Cam Guthrie, Rhys Stanley, Steven Motlop
F: Daniel Menzel, Tom Hawkins, Lincoln McCarthy
R: Zac Smith, Patrick Dangerfield, Mitch Duncan
IC: Nakia Cockatoo, Scott Selwood, Jed Bews, Darcy Lang</P>

<P>4. West Coast</P>

<P>The Eagles’ up-and-down form of last season — poor early, brilliant late before a shock home final defeat to the eventual premier — makes them difficult to place.
But their draw will be slightly easier than the other contenders because of their seventh-placed finish and the addition of Sam Mitchell to a midfield that needs a touch of class is huge.
The ruck position will be a headache until Nic Naitanui returns (unless Nathan Vardy is an immediate success) while the ability of Jack Darling to bounce back from a finals nightmare is also key.</P><P>B: Brad Sheppard, Will Schofield, Shannon Hurn
HB: Elliott Yeo, Jeremy McGovern, Sharrod Wellingham
C: Andrew Gaff, Sam Mitchell, Luke Shuey
HF: Mark Le Cras, Jack Darling, Dom Sheed
F: Scott Lycett, Josh Kennedy, Josh Hill
R: Jon Giles, Chris Masten, Matt Priddis
IC: Jack Redden, Mark Hutchings, Lewis Jetta, Sam Butler</P>

<P>3. Western Bulldogs</P>

<P>The age of the dogs suggests their poised to challange for many years to come, but this year I've got them just missing the Grand Final this year. Lat years miracle run for me wasjust a preview as to what lies ahead for these young dogs but I think they'll do much better in 2018 when they don't have the tag of reigning premeirs on their back, and unfortunatley, Bobby Murphy may never get a premeirship ring.</P>
<P>B: Matthew Boyd, Marcus Adams, Easton Wood
HB: Jason Johannisen, Dale Morris, Robert Murphy
C: Lachie Hunter, Marcus Bontempelli, Liam Picken
HF: Jackson Macrae, Travis Cloke, Jake Stringer
F: Tory Dickson, Tom Boyd, Stewart Crameri
R: Jordan Roughead, Luke Dahlhaus, Tom Liberatore
IC: Caleb Daniel, Toby McLean, Clay Smith, Shane Biggs</P>

<P>2. Sydney</P>

<P>As a dedicated Swans fan, it pains me deep to my core to give the giants the premeirship, and my hate for the little brother is stronger than ever after this year, but there's still many things to like about the swans. They have the best midfield, the best defence an the best attacker in the leauge. Buddy is great, but had a Grand Final shocker that undid all his hard work for the year,and Kurt Tippet is simply over paid, and not that good. He needs to go or the Swans will face more Tom Mitchell situations, and with Isaac Heeney of contract nxt year, the swans better hurry.</P>
<P>B: Jake Lloyd, Heath Grundy, Nick Smith
HB: Callum Mills, Aliir Aliir, Dane Rampe
C: Kieren Jack, Josh Kennedy, Jarrad McVeigh
HF: Isaac Heeney, Lance Franklin, George Hewett
F: Tom Papley, Kurt Tippett, Gary Rohan
R: Sam Naismith, Luke Parker, Daniel Hannebery
IC: Zak Jones, Jeremy Laidler, Brandon Jack, Harry Cunningham</P>

<P>1. GWS (It has to be done)</P>

<P>GWS will be a popular pick for the flag next season given the expected improvement in their young stars and the addition of Richmond veteran Brett Deledio.

The Giants farmed out another host of former early draft selections but the only ones missing from their preliminary final 22 are Rhys Palmer (who was only playing because Steve Johnson was suspended) and the retired Joel Patfull.
Jacob Hopper and Rory Lobb are the only players who have less than 50 games experience and there’s a host (Jeremy Cameron, Stephen Conigilio, Toby Greene, Phil Davis, Dylan Shiel and Devon Smith) set to crack 100 next year.
The defence probably needs to tighten slightly but there’s really no weakness in this squad.</P>
<P>B: Heath Shaw, Phil Davis, Nick Haynes
HB: Zac Williams, Adam Tomlinson, Nathan Wilson
C: Steven Coniglio, Dylan Shiel, Lachie Whitfield
HF: Devon Smith, Jeremy Cameron, Brett Deledio
F: Toby Greene, Jonathon Patton, Steve Johnson
R: Shane Mumford, Callan Ward, Tom Scully
IC: Rory Lobb, Jacob Hopper, Ryan Griffen, Josh Kelly</P>
